## Final Project for Web Development Applications
### by Jaime Garc√≠a Sevilla

## Project Description

WaitPlaying is a web platform designed by me to provide updated information on the release dates of video games and allow users to follow their favorite titles. In addition, I offer the possibility to filter games by platform and see which titles are available on the subscription services that users are subscribed to. Users will also be able to access a calendar with the release dates of the games they have selected to follow.

This project has been developed with ReactJS on the front-end and Django on the back-end.

## Project Objective
My goal is to offer users an intuitive and always updated tool to stay informed about the release dates of video games and follow their favorite titles. In addition, I want to make it easier to search for games by platform and allow users to know which titles are available on the subscription services to which they are subscribed. With the calendar, users will have at hand the release dates of the games they have chosen to follow.

## Main Features
- Updated information on the release dates of video games.
- Option to follow specific games.
- Game filter by platform.
- Visibility of which games are available on the subscription services to which users are subscribed.

## Potential future additions
- Social media integration: allow users to share information about games on their social media profiles, or connect through their social media accounts to use the platform.
- Recommendation system: use machine learning algorithms or data analysis to suggest games to users based on their tastes or what they are looking for.
- Game comments and reviews: allow users to write reviews or comments about the games they have played, and show this information to other users as a way to help them decide which games to try.
- Release alerts: send notifications to users when the release dates of the games they have selected to follow are approaching, or when there are important news about those titles.
- Points and rewards system: offer users points or rewards for performing certain actions on the platform, such as writing reviews or sharing information about games on social media. Users could redeem these points for rewards, such as discounts on games or access to exclusive content.
